With this project, I tried to make a similar game to the one that went viral a couple years ago (similar look, similar functionality). I wrote this code in the Java language in VS Code. As someone who is quite a novice in game development, this was challenging yet fun. This project touched topics like object-oriented programming (OOP), physics simulation, collision detection and game design. All in all a lot of problem-solving and debugging work was involved, but it was quite fun to see the whole game come together.
